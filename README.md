# Go-Kart Design and Analysis Project 

This repository documents the mechanical design, simulation, and validation tasks carried out during the development of a go-kart for IKR 2025.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Pedal Design (Throttle & Brake)
- Designed ergonomically optimized throttle and brake pedals.
- Focused on durability, driver comfort, and manufacturability.
  
### 2. Brake Disc Analysis
- **Structural FEA:** Assessed the brake disc's stress and deformation under braking loads.
- **Thermal FEA:** Evaluated heat generation and dissipation during intense braking conditions.

### 3. Chassis Manufacturing Support
- Selected appropriate material (e.g., AISI 1018) for strength-to-weight balance.
- Performed MIG welding, cutting, and grinding operations.
- Assisted in quality control during fabrication.

### 4. Powertrain Validation
- Prepared **Design Validation Plan (DVP)** for the powertrain to ensure performance under defined test conditions.
- Created a **DFMEA** to identify and mitigate potential failure modes early in the design.

## Tools & Software
- SolidWorks, ANSYS Workbench (Structural & Thermal), MS Excel
- MIG Welding Tools,Grinder, etc.
